The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model able to classify the 3 species of Iris flower using measurements of their petals and sepals.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper.
The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because 
Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in 
the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".


## About the data

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each 
sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly 
separable from each other. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. 

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently 
to this day. This data can be downloaded from the <a href="https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a> and differs from the 
data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick@espeedaz.net ). The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the 
error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.
